# Password Generator

![](https://i.imgur.com/mXnAlqn.png)

## This is my password generator which allows the user to generate random passwords with different variables available to them.

### The website can be viewed [here](https://pdsan97.github.io/Password-Generator/)

### Url - [https://github.com/pdsan97/Password-Generator](https://github.com/pdsan97/Password-Generator)

#### Notice: This is the third or fourth time I've had to copy this info to a workspace, whenever i try to push to origin VScode is turning it into a new workspace. Also for some reason the Gitpages checks are failing but the site is launched so im not sure what the issue is there.
